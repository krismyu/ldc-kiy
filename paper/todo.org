- [ ] Connect subsetting to including covariates 
- [X] Add in note about leaving off specification of word within
  experimental unit
- [ ] Add in note about small caps, itatlistic, etc.
- [ ] Add in technial mening of variance and "hugt"e and "Small"
  variance accounted for
- [ ] fillers
- [ ] Note on research hypotheses vs. null hypotheses

- [ ] Add factors
- [ ] Add EDA note
- [ ] repetition vs. replication
- [ ] sampling, generalization to population
- [ ] add in moving from tonal class to tonal sequence?
- [ ] Fix numbering for research hypotheses, variables
* Examples for paper
- [ ] Add kiy latent variable
      EXAMPLE OF EARLIEST ELICITATION: JUST ELICITING WORDS IN ISOLATION,
      MINIMAL SET AS LIMITING CASE---NOTE THAT MINIMAL SET MEANS THAT ALL
      CONTEXTUAL INFLUENCES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR!!! NOT JUST ``THE SAME
      WORD''.  
  
  EXPERIMENTAL UNIT IS EACH ELICITATION ITEM, NOT EACH WORD
  
  EXAMPLE: KIRIKIRI WORDS
  
  EXAMPLE: RESIDUAL
  FACTORIAL DESIGNS
  SAMOAN, OVER ALL WORD ORDERS
- [ ] Add Samoan example?
- [ ] Voice quality: Igbo
- [ ] Blocking: variability within blocking vs. without
- [ ] Example: order effects
- [ ] Add kiy vowel height example

* Refs
- Fix f0 measures table
- [X] Add Espo's new paper on White Hmong for generalization thing
-
-
* F0/pitch stuff
1. f0 vs. pitch vs. tone
   - Diagram of waveform with f0
   - Explain acoustic vs. perceptual
2. More detail on f0
   1. Transcription and detail, the role of recordings
      - Time processing phonetic data
      - Now recordings are cheap
      - summary elicitations
      - automated alignment, but need dictionary
      - What do recordings get you? f0 detection, resynthesis
        - Toney
        - 
      - Tutorials -> organizing files, processing data, may be
        outdated
   2. f0 detection [ see tutorial ] 
      - 
      - measure by hand
      - EGG
      - important to know 
      - autocorrelation
        - Flip and shift
      - cepstrum
      - narrow-band
      - perturbations and voice quality
      - why bother with transcription at all?
        - Toney does it all?
        - Need to choose level of relevant detail
        - acoustics vs. perception
3. f0 a set of parameters
   - transcription and resolution
   - different ways of parameterizing f0
   - normalization
4. beyond f0: voice quality
* Latex conversion
- Fix tables
